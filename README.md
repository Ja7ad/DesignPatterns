## Structural design patterns
Structural design patterns describe the relationships between the entities. They are used to
form large structures using classes and objects. These patterns are used to create a system
with different system blocks in a flexible manner. Adapter, bridge, composite, decorator,
facade, flyweight, private class data, and proxy are the Gang of Four (GoF) structural
design patterns. The private class data design pattern is the other design pattern covered in
this section.

| 1  | Adapter                             | [Adapter](/Structural/Adapter)                    |
| 2  | Bridge                              | [Birdge](/Structural/Birdge)                      |
| 3  | Composite                           | [Composite](/Structural/Composite)                |
| 4  | Decorator                           | [Decorator](/Structural/Decorator)                |
| 5  | Facade                              | [Facade](/Structural/Facade)                      |
| 6  | FlyWeight                           | [FlyWeight](/Structural/FlyWeight)                |
| 7  | Private Class Data                  | [PrivateClassData](/Structural/PrivateClassData)  |
| 8  | Proxy                               | [Proxy](/Structural/Proxy)                        |
